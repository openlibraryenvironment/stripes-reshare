# stripes-reshare

This is a library of common elements used by Stripes apps for the ReShare ILL system.

## Release Procedures
* To prepare for a release, create a branch called release-N.N.x where N.N is the major and minor versions, and x is the letter x.
* Push a tag to the release branch when changes are finalized.
* From the Github repository page, create a release from the tag created in the previous step.
* CI will publish appropriate artifacts when the release is published.
